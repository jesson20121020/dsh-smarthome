## ✨ What it looks like

Click any image to open the live demo — [`docs/demo.html`](docs/demo.html) simulates the full DSH conversation, and its live console talks to the bundled HA emulator (no real Home Assistant needed).

| ① Ask | ② Approval gate | ③ Done — state changed |
|---|---|---|
| <img src="docs/assets/demo-start.png" width="380" alt="start"> | <img src="docs/assets/demo-approval.png" width="380" alt="approval"> | <img src="docs/assets/demo-final.png" width="380" alt="final"> |
| The agent lists your lights with `ha_list_entities`. | `ha_call_service` pauses for a human approval dialog. | Approved — `ha_get_state` confirms the light turned on. |

**And the Web UI dashboard card** — call `ha_dashboard` and get a live snapshot of the whole home rendered right in the conversation:

**The Home Assistant it plugs into** — a typical smart-home dashboard like this one (illustration):

## 🎯 What can it do?

Talk to your home the way you talk to an assistant — every write goes through a human approval gate first.

| You say | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Check the whole house — which devices are still on?" | Agent scans with `ha_list_entities` / `ha_get_state` and summarizes |
| "Show me the home dashboard." | `ha_dashboard` renders a **live dashboard card** in the conversation — devices, scenes and recent changes at a glance |
| "Wait until the washer finishes, then tell me on my phone." | `ha_wait_for_state` polls to completion → `ha_notify` pushes to HA |
| "What's the weather tomorrow — should I take an umbrella?" | `ha_weather` returns a structured forecast |
| "Set the bedroom light to 200 brightness." | `ha_call_service` → **approval dialog** → executes → state updates instantly |
| "Turn off every light in the living room." | **Area targeting** — one call controls the whole room |
| "Start cinema mode." | Scene activation: dimmed lights + TV on — a whole cascade of devices in one shot (`ha_events` shows each change live) |
| "What changed in the house in the last hour?" | Real-time `state_changed` events from the **WebSocket** feed |
| "Is the living room warm enough? Compare with the bedroom." | `ha_get_state` / `ha_render_template` over sensors |
| "Turn everything off, I'm leaving." | One scene (`scene.away`) or a multi-entity service call |

## 💡 Why it's good — how useful is it?

- **One-line install**: `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-smarthome`, then just talk to the agent.
- **Safe by default**: every state-changing call stops for human approval; `allowedDomains` is a second deny-list belt. The agent can never touch your home without you saying yes.
- **Natural language control**: no apps to fiddle with, no API docs to memorize — "dim the lights" just works.
- **Always current**: state changes reach the agent in real time over WebSocket, so it never "thinks" the light is still on when you switched it off.
- **Lightweight**: zero runtime dependencies — plain REST + Node's built-in WebSocket. No MQTT broker, no extra daemon.
- **Try it without Home Assistant**: the repo ships a demo emulator + interactive demo page — 5 minutes to a full feel of the plugin.
- **Engineered, not hacked together**: 36 tests including a full **real agent-loop end-to-end** suite, strict TypeScript, CI.

## 💻 Your computer is the control center

dsh-smarthome runs right where dsh runs — **on your computer**. No phone app, no separate bridge, no context switch:

- **👀 Monitor while you work** — the dashboard card (`ha_dashboard`) and the real-time event feed (`ha_events`) keep the whole house visible next to your editor: what's on, what just changed.
- **🎙️ Control by voice** — add a community voice plugin to dsh (search the [`dsh-plugin` topic](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) for *voice*; e.g. [dsh-voice](https://github.com/zhuiyueya/dsh-voice) does zero-key speech input + read-aloud, `dsh-voice-chat` does real-time speech) and just **speak**: *"turn the bedroom light to 200"* → approval → done. Hands-free while you keep typing.
- **🖥️ Everything in one window** — code, watch the house, and control devices without ever leaving dsh. Every state-changing call still waits for your approval.

>
> "What changed in the house in the last hour?" *(real-time `ha_events`)*

## 📦 Install

Requires **dsh ≥ 0.2.0-rc.1** — this fork is verified against the published `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2` line. The npm `dsh-smarthome@1.4.0` release targets the older 0.1.x harness and is rejected by the 0.2.x compatibility gate, so install from this fork until that is released.

```sh
# From this fork (source install — pnpm builds on the fly):
dsh plugin --profile web add github:jesson20121020/dsh-smarthome
# If pnpm refuses to run the prepare build on a git dependency, allow it once:
#   add this to <profile>/pnpm-workspace.yaml, then re-run the add:
#     allowBuilds:
#       dsh-smarthome: true
```

Restart `dsh --profile web` after installing. Manage it in **Settings → Plugins**.

## 🧪 Try it without Home Assistant (demo mode)

No HA instance? The repo ships a **fake HA emulator** with a small living demo home whose state *actually changes* when you call services — perfect for trying the plugin before wiring up real hardware.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jesson20121020/dsh-smarthome
cd dsh-smarthome
pnpm install
pnpm demo:ha          # serves a fake Home Assistant at http://127.0.0.1:8124
```

In another terminal, configure the plugin (add to your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`):

```yaml
- id: smarthome
  config:
    baseUrl: http://127.0.0.1:8124
    tokenEnv: HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN
```

Then start dsh and try:

```sh
HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=demo-token dsh --profile web
```

> "Check that Home Assistant is reachable, then list the lights."
>
> "Turn on the bedroom light at 200 brightness." — an approval request pops up; approve it, and `ha_get_state` will show the light is actually `on` with `brightness: 200`.
>
> "Turn off every light in the living room." — area targeting via the WebSocket area registry.
>
> "What changed in the last minute?" — real-time `state_changed` events from the WebSocket feed.

The emulator also drifts the temperature sensor every few seconds, so `ha_history` and `ha_events` always have fresh data. Any `Bearer` token works; `demo-token` is just the convention.

**Want to preview the UI without running dsh at all?** Open [`docs/demo.html`](docs/demo.html) in a browser: it replays a simulated DSH conversation (tool cards + the approval dialog), and its live console talks to the emulator directly when it's running.

Ready-to-paste configs (demo / real HA / no-approval) live in [`examples/cordis.patch.yml`](examples/cordis.patch.yml).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a long-lived access token in Home Assistant: **Profile → Security → Long-lived access tokens**.

Override the plugin row in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (later layers win):

```yaml
- id: smarthome
  config:
    baseUrl: http://192.168.1.10:8123   # your Home Assistant instance
    token: ''                           # prefer tokenEnv over committing a token
    tokenEnv: HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN      # env var holding the token
    timeoutMs: 15000
    requireApproval: true               # human approval for state-changing calls
    allowedDomains: []                  # e.g. ["light", "switch"]; empty = all domains
    maxHistoryEvents: 200
    wsEnabled: true                     # real-time events + area registry (WebSocket)
    eventBufferSize: 50                 # rolling ha_events buffer size
```

Then run dsh with the variable set:

```sh
HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=<token> dsh --profile web
```

`baseUrl` defaults to `http://homeassistant.local:8123` (the standard Home Assistant mDNS host). If no token is configured the plugin still loads — every tool call fails with a clear "not configured" message instead of crashing the harness.

### How the token is resolved

`tokenEnv` is a **credential reference** resolved through the harness's [credential seam](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/tree/main/packages/credentials): when the `credentials` service is present, the value is read from its layered sources (process environment → `<cwd>/.env` → `$DSH_HOME/.env`), falling back to `process.env` directly otherwise. The token is re-resolved **per request / per socket connection**, so a rotated credential reaches the very next call without a restart.

## 🔒 Security

- A Home Assistant token can control **everything** in your instance — there is no per-entity scope. That is why `requireApproval` defaults to `true` and `ha_call_service` / `ha_render_template` always route through the harness approval seam.
- `allowedDomains` is a second belt: when set, service calls on other domains are denied outright.
- Prefer `tokenEnv` over `token` so the secret never lands in a committed config file.

## 🛠 Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck   # strict TS against the published @deepseek-ai/* types
pnpm build       # bundle lib/ (ESM + d.ts)
pnpm test        # 24 tests: client suite + real ToolRuntime integration + full agent-loop E2E
node scripts/capture-demo.mjs   # regenerate the README screenshots
```

## 📋 Compatibility

### Real Home Assistant compatibility

- Uses the **v1 REST API** (`/api/states`, `/api/services/…`, `/api/history/…`, `/api/template`, `/api/config`) and the **WebSocket API** (`/api/websocket`: auth, `subscribe_events`, `config/area_registry/list`, `config/device_registry/list`) — the same protocols the official HA frontend speaks.
- Requires a **long-lived access token** (Profile → Security → Long-lived access tokens).
- Caveats: self-signed HTTPS certificates are not supported (use `http://` or a valid cert); a restricted token that cannot call services will fail `ha_call_service`.

This fork tracks the published `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2` line; if a harness update breaks it, please open an issue.
